       <h2>HTML</h2>
       <ul>
         <li>The head element contains information about the webpage.</li>
         <li>The metadata in the head element helps the browser to render the page correctly.</li>
         <li>Elements within the head are not visible to the user when they look at the webpage.</li>
         <li>The body element represents the visible content shown to the user.</li>
         <li>An element is a type of content on a webpage.</li>
         <li>Elements can also divide and describe a page.</li>
         <li>HTML attributes are always defined in the beginning element but never the closing element.</li>
         <li>Elements nested inside other elements are called child elements.</li>
         <li>The element that holds all the children is called the parent element.</li>
         <li>In semantic HTML elements, the name of the element describes its content and the role it plays on a webpage.</li>
         <li>A tag refers to only what appears inside the angled brackets.</li>
         <li>The footer element appears at the bottom of the page and usually contains the author, copyright, contact, sitemap and navigation.</li>
         <li>The section element is a semantic element that defines a section in a document that contains thematic content.</li>

       <h2>CSS</h2>
       <ul>
         <li>A margin indicates how much space we want around the outside of an element.</li>
         <li>A padding indicates how much space we want around the content inside the element.</li>
         <li>Inline CSS is used to style an element directly in the HTML file.</li>
         <li>Internal CSS Style Sheet allows you to embed an entire stylesheet directly in the HTML file using a style element in the head element.</li>
         <li>External CSS Style Sheet allows you to keep all your CSS rules in a separate file, which makes design changes easier.</li>
         <li>Separation of Concerns refers to separating code into different files based on use.</li>
         <li>touch style.css creates a file that will contain a CSS style sheet.</li>
         <li>* selector declares that all element on the page will have the style you have used in the CSS rule.</li>
         <li>The img selector assigns property values to any image element in the markup.</li>
         <li>The link element creates a connection to an external file.</li>
         <li>The rel attribute specifies the relationship between the current document and the linked document resource.</li>
         <li>The href attribute specifies the location of the external resource.</li>
         <li>A class attribute allows you to share a CSS rule to any element you choose by assigning the rule to a class attribute with a class selector.</li>
         <li>You can assign colors in CSS by semantic features such as gray and blue but you can also refer to a color by its hexadecimal code.</li>

       <h2>JavaScript</h2>
       <ul>
         <li>A variable is a named container that allows us to store data in our code.</li>
         <li>Control flow is the order in which a computer executes code in a script.</li>
         <li>A string is a sequence of text enclosed in quotation marks.</li>
         <li>Numbers do not have quotes around them.</li>
         <li>A boolean is a True/False value.</li>
         <li>An array is a structure that allows you to store multiple values in a single reference.</li>
         <li>An object can be anything. Everything in JavaScript is an object and can be stored in a variable.</li>
         <li>To declare a variable, use the var keyword.</li>
         <li>console.log() outputs a message to the web console by adding an argument.</li>
         <li>An if statement introduces decision-making to our code and the code will only execute if the statement meets a condition, or is true.</li>
         <li>The strict equality operator (===) checks to see if two values are equal, and returns a boolean result true if the values are equal and false if the values are not equal.</li>
         <li>The location of a data item in an array can be identified with a unique number called an index.</li>
         <li>The indices, or location identifiers, will always be whole numbers that increase by 1 each time.</li>
         <li>A for loop uses the predictable pattern of indices to perform a task on all the items in an array by allowing a single code block to be executed over and over.</li>
         <li>The array length is important because the for loop needs to know how many times the code will run until there are no items left in the array.</li>
         <li>A function is a set of instructions that tells the computer how to perform a certain task.</li>
         <li>A function name is followed by parentheses ().</li>
         <li>To randomise a selection, we need to use a special Math function that helps us select a random number.</li>
