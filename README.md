# Prework Study Guide Website

## Description

I have built a website that contains everything I have learnt through my prework so that I, and other bootcamp students, can look at this guide to read through important notes on each topic. This website contains information about HTML, CSS, Git, and JavaScript.

## Installation

## Usage

Each section in the website contains notes on a certain topic, like HTML, CSS, Git, and JavaScript. If you open the DevTools console, using Command+Option+I for macOS or Control+Shift+I for Windows, you will find the JavaScript running and you will be prompted to choose a subject you would like to study from the subjects listed.
